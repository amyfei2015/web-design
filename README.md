Project outline
I write a fake business websites to sell books. Images of items with names and number of storage are neatly presented underneath. A menu bar on left will direct users to different categories of items. Users can only browse items when they are not logged in. When they click the name of a product, a pop up form will show asking number of items they want to add it to cart. There will be a “view cart” button, and by clicking it, user will see the existing items in cart and the total cost on a new page with a functional “check out” button. If the order is proceeded,  the cart become empty and the number of storage will also be updated. When user login, a secret selection will be shown on menu bar as well as a contact button.  By pressing it, the users will be directed to a page to contact the web masters. There is also a webmaster count, and for web masters, they will not be able to purchase items but will be able to see inventory records, all order histories and all messages sent by user.


I use HTML & CSS to line up the menu bar and items neatly and apply some aesthetic features. I apply JAVASCRIPT in applying functions and getting information from some forms and buttons, which I send to php files are modify using php. I use PHP heavily in this website to manage database including user information and build the register and login system. Also, Most of pages and functions are written in php.
